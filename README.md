## Project Overview

### The goal

The goal of this project is to create a personal website where projects can be showed. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.
The site should be simple and easy to navigate.
The design should be clean and simple.

### Framework

React is chosen as a framework.
The languages used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
UI framework is Tailwind CSS.
Framer Motion is used for animations.
VS Code is used as the IDE.

### Reflection

- Spent too much time on the design, i.e., fonts, colors, etc.
- The site is not developed with mobile first in mind (learnt this the hard way ðŸ¥²).
  - Default sm of Tailwind CSS is not small enough. Changed from 640px to 576px.
- Centering the div.

### Further development

1. Double check the responsiveness.
2. Hero section.
3. Remake the navigation.
4. Better page transitions.
5. Add more projects.
6. Redo the design.
